class FlightSearch:

    # Searching for Flights
    # The next step is to search for the flight prices from London (LON)
    # to all the destinations in the Google Sheet.
    # In this project, we're looking only for direct flights,
    # that leave anytime between tomorrow and in 6 months (6x30days) time.
    # We're also looking for round trips that return between 7 and 28 days in length.
    # The currency of the price we get back should be in GBP or HKD.

    # This class is responsible for talking to the Flight Search API.
